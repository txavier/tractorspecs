                        <strong>How do you determine pricing?</strong><br>
                        The pricing engine weights several factors in determining equipment values. Our starting data is based upon used listings put forth by equipment dealerships. This is run though a simple depriciation curve based on the type of equipment and its age. This is a simular method used by equipment blue books. While a mathamatical equasion can give an idea of equipment value, its only a guideline and not a substitue for an experienced appriasor.
